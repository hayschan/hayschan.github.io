              <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Before I begin, I would ask you...not to switch off your phone...because what I'll be talking today muchly relates to mobile phones.  If you look at the top of your phone's display, you'll see the signal indicator.  For me, there is four bars now.  What about a place with <strong>more people, more devices and more interference</strong>?  The metro!  Everytime my friend Kimmy and I take the subway, she has a hard time searching for internet signal, despite the fact that she is using the flagship model of the iPhone line.</p>
<p>Has anyone played PUBG (和平精英)?  Please raise your hands.  If you're a big fan of the game like me, you must have experienced some kind of lagging - the game reacts a few second after you operates.  This is called <strong>latency</strong> in a computer network: a time delay between your finger pressing the fire button and your enemy being dead.  Because of the latency, the game is glitchy which totally destoys the play.  Precisely speaking, latency is the time interval between the stimulation and response.</p>
<p>Next one, has anyone downloaded a movie from the internet?  Let me see your hands.  Let me give an educated guess on how long you spent on downloading: 30 mins?  An hour?  Or did you give up in hopelessness and regrets?  [to be completed]</p>
<h2 id="what-is-5g">What is 5G</h2>
<p>In short, with 5G<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, we will be able to send data <strong>faster</strong>, with <strong>less delay</strong> and <strong>more reliable</strong>. [to be completed]</p>
<p>Remember the example of latency on PUBG?  4G networks have about 50 milliseconds of latency even in good network condition.  With latencies of less than 5 milliseconds, 5G networks are expected to be more than 10 times better.  If you lose in PUBG next time, you may explain to your teammates: it's not because my skills, its all about the network latency.</p>
<h2 id="application-of-5g">Application of 5G</h2>
<p>5G will boost any field that can benefits from the feature of 5G: low latency and high bandwidth.</p>
<h3 id="remote-surgery">Remote Surgery</h3>
<p>Doctors in China have used 5G to perform remote surgery, inserting a stimulation device in the brain of a Parkinson's patient from nearly 1,900 miles away.<br>
5G makes this possible by cutting latency to an almost instantaneous 2 milliseconds between devices, allowing surgeons to conduct procedures as if they were right next to the patient.<br>
The tech could give private healthcare providers an edge over rivals, and the ability to provide services to patients further afield as 5G coverage increases.</p>
<h3 id="self-driving-cars">Self-driving cars</h3>
<p>Tech giants, like Google and Uber, have been investing heavily in autonomous vehicles.</p>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<p>The increased performance of 5G relies on much higher density of base stations, larger bandwidths, and faster chips.  This will, in no doubt, result in much higher cost in building 5G network, exponentially higher that it was when 4G was upgraded from 3G.  The biggest problem with 5G is its cost as the technology and the equipments are expensive.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-need-for-5g">What's the need for 5G?</h3>
<p>5G is way less urgent than we expected.  Most of the imaginative scenarios that are currently suggested can be carried out through 4G.  We haven’t even maxed out 4G theoretical speed.  The average real-world download speeds of 4G in China is about 20Mbps, while the theoretical limit is 300Mbps, a whopping difference of 15 times.</p>
<p>Some may fantasize the usefulness of the high reliability and low latency of 5G.  However, the technical difficulty is so large that to achieve such goal, the cost has to be doubled.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>The operation cost of running a 5G network is high, namely the electricity.  Downloading a 1GB movie is equivalent to one hour of continuous operation of a 2000W hair dryer.  Let’s take the price of electricity in Beijing - to download a 1GB movie, the internet operator, such as Yi Dong, has to pay 1 yuan for electricity.  That is the electricity cost for the operator.  If you count in its infrastructure cost and profit, consumers will have a hard time affording 5G.  And that was what Dian Xin’s CEO said, monthly subscription fee of 5G mobile plans will not be less than 200 Yuan.</p>
<p>According to estimates, the power consumption of a single set of 5G base station is about 4-5 times that of 4G base stations.</p>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>Due to joint marketing effort between some phone manufacturers and the media, the public are overhyped on 5G.    They believe that such tech will change their life and the world.   Some folks even take 5G as the core battlefield of the current trade war between China and the US.</p>
<p>However, they often overlooked the heavy cost required to upgrade to 5G.  The citizens will be the ones paying for 5G.  I urge governments around the world to help the public have a clear understanding on the truth of the tech.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have no reason to hurry.  It is not a tech we cannot live without when we are in a time that only 6% of 4G speed is utilized.</p>
<h2 id="effects-of-5g">Effects of 5G</h2>
<h3 id="will-5g-expand-the-digital-divide-further">Will 5G expand the digital divide further?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A digital divide is any uneven distribution in the access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have spent plenty of time on the bright and dark side of 5G.  But please don't forget the tens of thousands of people from suburban and rural communities awaiting internet connection of any kind.</p>
